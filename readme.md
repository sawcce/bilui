# bilui (lib ui)

This project is demo/wip attempt at making a desktop ui framework using rust and sdl2

Plans:
- Boxes
- Layouts
- Text
- Stylesheets
- Yaml support ?

## Questions

As you might have seen layouts are bascially a box that matches the size of it's parent and arranges it's children in a specific fashion. 

This might be subject to changes in the future as it is not really readable.
